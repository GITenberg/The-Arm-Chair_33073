<h2>MEMORANDUM.</h2>

<p>The history of these rhymes is briefly this.&mdash;An
Arm Chair, made many years ago by <span class="smcap">John Letchworth</span>,
for <span class="smcap">Leonard</span> and <span class="smcap">Jane Snowdon</span>, was presented
to the Author, with some information of the
worthies who were wont to visit the estimable
owners; accompanied with an intimation that it
would be a suitable theme for some verses. The
result follows.</p>

<span class="i1"><span class="smcap"><b>Cowper</b></span>, the poet of the Christian muse,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some of his talent in my laggard quill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some of his genius on my verse distil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then would I sing,&mdash;my theme too from the fair,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy coevals, rhyme-creating chair!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">He who with artist's skill scooped out thy seat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now fourscore years and four has measured o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waits his summons to the heavenly shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honest as sunshine, he "who runs may read,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That <span class="smcap"><b>Letchworth</b></span> is "an Israelite indeed;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No guile within him ever finds a place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love of the Father spreads to all the race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gospel ministry is void of show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For "few and savory" are the words that flow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Condensed and pithy are his periods found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich in their matter, nothing for mere sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So preaches he. Ah, what a sad mistake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When empty sounds upon the people break,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">When a stentorian voice in efforts vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roars to the people,&mdash;thunder without rain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its booming echoes may the soul appal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no reviving showers on nature fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Would that my age,&mdash;if age to me be given,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might prove like his, who calmly looks to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting with patience for the mandate blessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thy labour finished, enter into rest!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Here," said the patriarch, no more doomed to range,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Quiet I lie, waiting my final change."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go when thou wilt, thy faithful life will prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rich example, legacy of love!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Ah, my Arm Chair, supporter of the good,<br /></span>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Here <span class="smcap"><b>Harrison</b></span>[<a href="#notea">1</a>] has spoke of what she saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In visions deep, when filled with holy awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curtain of the future half withdrew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While coming objects glided into view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as the past on memory's tablet rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rehearsed her gospel joys, her gospel woes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told how King George, as gushed the hidden springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowed at her message from the King of kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of deep probations for her Lord she past;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">Of her fond hope of joining him at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told how her soul, in sympathy, had long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne a deep burthen for the negro's wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till the church freed her at her Master's will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In southern states love's purpose to fulfil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gospel power for Truth and right she spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till slumbering consciences to feeling woke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppressors' hearts with justice learned to beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While bondmen's shackles fell beneath their feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her's was a righteous mission; to the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of selfish masters she her message bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shot no fiery missiles from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindling those feelings that engender war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But face to face Truth's message would impart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst love-tipped arrows entered many a heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus won she freedom for the sore oppressed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her work was honoured and her labour blessed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Or as the present did her thoughts engage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave to her juniors dear-bought counsel sage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bade her loved niece preserve in vessel pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sacred gift, and make her calling sure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bade her true partner as an Aaron be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uphold her hands, support her ministry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full well dear <span class="smcap"><b>Leonard</b></span> thou that charge redeemed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When through her heart the gospel current streamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In secret labour was thy spirit found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While trembling forth she sent the gospel sound;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
    <span class="i0">A very Quaker,&mdash;as she gave the law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her outward motion spoke her inward awe.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Here <span class="smcap"><b>Scattergood</b></span>, when evening came at length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the day's toil reposed his weary strength;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Christian sympathy that solace drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which those can grant who heavenly joys pursue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mournful of spirit, he was ever found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sympathy with souls by sorrow bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fell his plaintive voice upon the ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poor in spirit felt a friend was near.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prompt in his duty at the house of prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To plead with fervour for his Master there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While crowds hung trembling on that zealous tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which only woke as living waters sprung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never preached himself,&mdash;his every word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Directed to a slain and risen Lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He to the weary consolation brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He for the burthened sweet deliverance wrought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though bound himself, the fettered oft set free,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Jeremiah of his age was he!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1"><span class="smcap"><b>Savery</b></span> has here oft passed a friendly hour,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">As prayer ascended where no knee was bent,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for each other's welfare sighs were given,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>

<span class="i0">An anxious labourer for the redman's good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the lake, beneath the spreading tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gospel message flowed as Truth set free.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">Here too has sat,&mdash;like him of stature small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great too of heart,&mdash;a minister like Paul,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One who, obedient to his Master's will,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And still returning from his work of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came with his olive-branch and peaceful dove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though years rolled on and outward sight grew dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lamp of Truth still brightly burned with him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showing distinctly in its searching light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deeds that the actors deemed were hid in night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His urim and his thummim was with God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he obedient to his Master's nod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As secret feeling told him of distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sufferer's door-sill soon his foot would press.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Mercy led,&mdash;and pleasantly he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he "by jobbing earned his daily bread."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, these were luscious morsels, ate with joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heavenly relish free from all alloy;<br /></span>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
